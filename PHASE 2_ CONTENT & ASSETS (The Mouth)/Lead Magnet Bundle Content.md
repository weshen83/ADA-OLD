# **📂 THE SAFE HARBOR KIT: DEC 2025 COMPLIANCE BUNDLE**

This bundle is designed to transition a lead from "Skeptical" to "Systemically Aware." It contains three core assets that establish our "Institutional Authority."

## 

## **ASSET 1: THE DEC 2025 FORENSIC CHECKLIST**

**Format:** A 1-page "Self-Diagnostic" sheet for Business Owners.

### **Header: \[OFFICIAL USE\] Website Liability Self-Assessment**

**Instruction:** If you check more than 3 of the following, your domain is currently in the "High-Risk" automated scan pool for Q1 2026\.  
**1\. Image Metadata (The "Low Hanging Fruit")**

* \[ \] Do you have a hero image, logo, or product photo that does not have descriptive 'Alt-Text' in the code?  
* \[ \] *Why it matters:* This is the \#1 violation cited in 82% of demand letters.

**2\. Structural Landmarks (The "Screen Reader" Test)**

* \[ \] Does your site use standard ARIA landmarks (e.g., role="navigation") to help blind users identify where they are?  
* \[ \] *Why it matters:* Without these, a blind user is "trapped" on your homepage.

**3\. Keyboard Navigation (The "Mouse-Free" Test)**

* \[ \] Try to navigate your site using only the "Tab" and "Enter" keys. Can you reach every button?  
* \[ \] *Why it matters:* "Keyboard Traps" are a primary target for professional human plaintiffs.

**4\. Form Accessibility**

* \[ \] Does your "Contact Us" or "Checkout" form have clearly labeled fields that a screen reader can announce?  
* \[ \] *Why it matters:* If a disabled user cannot contact you, you have a "Nexus of Discrimination."
