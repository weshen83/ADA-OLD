# **💻 TECHNICAL EXECUTION & VIBE CODING ROADMAP (v2.0)**

**Optimization Target:** Google Antigravity IDE & Gemini 3 Pro Agents **Methodology:** Context-First Engineering **Status:** Approved by Global Technical Standards Board

### **🧠 MODULE A: THE AI CONTEXT LAYER (The "Brain" of the IDE)**

*These documents are NOT for humans. They are optimized token-dense instructions for the AI Agent.*

1. **antigravity\_system\_protocol.md**  
   * *Purpose:* The "Constitution." It defines the Agent's persona ("Senior Forensic Architect"), the Tech Stack (Next.js 15, Tailwind v4, TypeScript 6.0), and the **"No-Hallucination" Rules** (e.g., "Never invent an API endpoint; strictly follow the schema").  
2. **project\_context\_crystal.json** (CRITICAL UPDATE)  
   * *Purpose:* A massive, structured JSON file compressing the Business Logic, Unit Economics, and Legal Constraints into a single machine-readable object. This is the first file loaded into the IDE's context window.  
3. **vibe\_coding\_style\_guide.md**  
   * *Purpose:* Visual-to-Code translation rules.  
   * *Content:* "When we say 'Forensic', use JetBrains Mono. When we say 'Alert', use \#FF3333 with a 0.2s pulse animation."

### **🏗️ MODULE B: BACKEND & INFRASTRUCTURE (The "Iron")**

*Built first to ensure the Frontend has real APIs to talk to.*

1. **sniffer\_engine\_architecture\_v2.md**  
   * *Red-Team Upgrade:* Added "Honeypot Evasion." How the script detects fake "trap" sites designed to ban bots.  
   * *Content:* Node.js / Playwright logic, Proxy Rotation middleware, and the specific regex patterns for 2025-era widget detection.  
2. **api\_gateway\_and\_webhook\_security.md**  
   * *Purpose:* Defining the n8n \<-\> Next.js handshake.  
   * *Content:* Signature verification logic (HMAC), Rate Limiting (preventing DDOS on your audit endpoint), and CORS policies.  
3. **database\_schema\_and\_types.ts**  
   * *Purpose:* A TypeScript definition file that forces the AI to use strict typing for every database interaction (Baserow/Attio).

### **🎨 MODULE C: FRONTEND & INTERACTION (The "Glass")**

*Vibe coding the user experience.*

1. **nextjs\_app\_router\_structure.md**  
   * *Purpose:* Defining the folder structure (/app, /components, /lib).  
   * *Content:* Explicit instructions on **Server Actions** vs. **Client Components** to ensure the site gets a 100/100 Lighthouse score (vital for "Trust").  
2. **gsap\_forensic\_animation\_library.md**  
   * *Purpose:* Modular animation code blocks.  
   * *Content:* The "Scan Stagger," The "Terminal Typewriter," and the "Red-Alert Pulse." Pre-written functions the AI can just call by name.  
3. **dynamic\_audit\_component\_logic.md**  
   * *Purpose:* The logic for the /audit/\[domain\] page.  
   * *Content:* How to handle "Loading States" (The Labor Illusion) and "Fallback States" (Randomized data if the CSV lookup fails) without breaking the user's suspension of disbelief.

### **🛡️ MODULE D: SECURITY & COMPLIANCE (The "Armor")**

*Self-auditing code to ensure we practice what we preach.*

1. **automated\_a11y\_testing\_suite.md**  
   * *Purpose:* Instructions for the AI to write **Playwright** tests that scan *our own* localhost build for ADA violations every time we save a file. (We cannot sell compliance if we aren't compliant).  
   * *Tools:* axe-core integration.  
2. **gdpr\_ccpa\_privacy\_layer.md**  
   * *Purpose:* Cookie consent logic and data purging protocols.

### **🚀 MODULE E: DEPLOYMENT & CI/CD**

*Getting it live.*

1. **vercel\_deployment\_config.md**  
   * *Purpose:* Environment variable mapping and edge-function configuration.  
2. **harden\_vps\_security\_sop.md**  
   * *Purpose:* Instructions for locking down the Hetzner VPS (Firewall rules, SSH key management) to prevent the "Sniffer" from being hijacked.
