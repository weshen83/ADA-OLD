# **🚀 PHASE 2: THE $100K/MO SCALING ROADMAP (v1.0)**

Phase 1 was the "Blitz"—proving the arbitrage. Phase 2 is the "Engine"—systematizing the capture of the $20B accessibility compliance market.

## 

## **1\. FROM "BLITZ" TO "ENGINE": ACQUISITION SHIFT**

We move from 100% Cold Outreach (GSA) to a "Surround Sound" marketing approach.

### **A. High-Intent Search (Google Ads)**

* **Target Keywords:** "ADA Website Lawsuit," "WCAG Compliance Service," "Sued for website accessibility."  
* **Strategy:** These are "Emergency" searches. We bid for the \#1 spot and drive them directly to the **Forensic Audit** page.

### **B. "Fear-Based" Retargeting (Meta/LinkedIn)**

* **Logic:** If a lead runs a scan but doesn't buy the Shield, they are retargeted for 30 days with:  
  * "New Lawsuit Alert" videos in their specific industry.  
  * Testimonials from business owners who settled for $15k before finding us.

## 

## **2\. THE SAAS PIVOT: FROM ONE-TIME TO MRR**

To increase the valuation of the business, we must move from one-time fees to **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**.

| Product | Current Model | Phase 2 SaaS Model |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Shield** | $297 One-Time | **$49/mo** (Continuous Monitoring & Updates). |
| **Compliance Kit** | Free Lead Magnet | **$197/year** (Safe Harbor Membership). |
| **Manual Audit** | One-Time Project | **Quarterly Audit Review** ($497/quarter). |

**The "Inertia" Hook:** "As WCAG standards update (e.g., from 2.1 to 2.2), your Shield updates automatically. Stay protected for the price of a monthly software subscription."

## 

## **3\. BUILDING THE "SALES ARMY"**

Julian cannot be the only one on the phone. We build a commission-only sales pod.

* **The "Closer" Pod:** 3 Sales reps handling the "Technical Scope Calls."  
* **The Commission:** 20% on all Manual Remediation deals ($500+ per close).  
* **The Tools:** Upgrade Attio logic to include a "Round Robin" lead distribution system.

## 

## **4\. PRODUCT LINE EXPANSION (NEW REVENUE STREAMS)**

1. **The "Accessibility Statement" Generator:** A $97 standalone tool that generates a legally-vetted "Good Faith" statement for their footer.  
2. **Staff Sensitivity Training:** A $497 video course for the client’s employees on how to handle disabled customers (mandatory for certain settlements).  
3. **The "White Label" Program:** Sell the "Forensic Audit" interface to Web Agencies for $1,000/mo, allowing them to sell ADA services to their own clients.

## 

## **5\. INFRASTRUCTURE & OPSEC UPGRADES**

Scaling from 50k to 500k leads per month requires "Enterprise" stability.

* **Move to Kubernetes:** Transition the Sniffer Script from a single VPS to a containerized cluster to handle 10,000 simultaneous scans.  
* **Multi-Gateway Payment:** Introduce **Adyen** or **Authorize.net** alongside Stripe to diversify the "Payment Freeze" risk.  
* **Secondary CRM:** Sync Attio data to **HubSpot** for more advanced email marketing automation.

## 

## **6\. RED-TEAM SCALING CONTROLS (THE "WALL" AUDIT)**

**1\. Market Saturation:**

* **Red-Team Risk:** We burn through the 500k "Highest Risk" leads in 6 months.  
* **Response:** Expand the "Sniffer" to international markets (UK, Canada, Australia) where similar accessibility laws are being aggressively enforced.

**2\. Legal Counter-Attacks:**

* **Red-Team Risk:** Professional plaintiff firms sue *us* for "Interfering with Contractual Relations."  
* **Response:** Move the "Statement of Compliance" to be an insurance-backed product. Partner with a boutique MGA (Managing General Agent) to provide a "$25,000 Litigation Reimbursement Guarantee" with every Shield purchase.

**3\. Platform De-platforming:**

* **Red-Team Risk:** Google Ads bans "Legal Scare" tactics.  
* **Response:** Pivot to "Compliance" and "Inclusion" branding. Focus on the *Benefits* of reaching disabled consumers (a $13T global market) rather than just the fear of lawsuits.
