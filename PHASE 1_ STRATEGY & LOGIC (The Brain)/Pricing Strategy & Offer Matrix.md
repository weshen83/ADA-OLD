### **Per-Template Pricing Model**

We bill by **Page Templates**, not total URLs. This ensures the client feels they are getting a deal while protecting our labor margins.

| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

* **Definition of a Template:** Home, Product Page, Contact, Category, Checkout.  
* **The Upsell Hook:** "You have 5,000 products, but they all use 1 template. You pay for the template, and we fix 5,000 pages for the price of one."

## **3\. THE IRS SECTION 44 "MAGIC BULLET" MATH**

Julian must be fluent in this math to close deals.  
**The Formula:**  
*(Max credit of $5,000 per year)*  
**Example: A $2,790 Manual Remediation Package**

1. Gross Cost: \\$2,790  
2. Minus Threshold: \\$2,790 \- \\$250 \= \\$2,540  
3. Credit Amount: \\$2,540 \\times 0.50 \= \\$1,270  
4. **Final Net Cost:** \\$2,790 \- \\$1,270 \= \\$1,520

**Eligibility Requirements:**

* Revenue under \\$1,000,000 OR fewer than 30 full-time employees.  
* We provide the pre-filled **IRS Form 8826** to make this "Zero-Friction."

## **4\. PARTNER REFERRAL MATRIX (ARBITRAGE)**

For leads we cannot fulfill internally, we monetize via high-ticket referrals.

| Scenario | Partner | Our Referral Fee |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Active Lawsuit** | Defense Attorney | **$500.00** (Flat per case) |
| **Platform Rebuild** | Web Agency | **$500.00** (On deposit) |
| **Annual Audit** | Internal Retainer | **$197.00** (Per Year) |

## **5\. RED-TEAM OBJECTION-CRUSHER MATRIX**

| Objection | The "Red-Team" Response |
| :---- | :---- |
| **"It's too expensive."** | "A $297 shield is an investment to prevent a $15,000 settlement. With the tax credit, you are paying the IRS $148 less this year to protect your business." |
| **"My dev said he'll do it."** | "Your dev builds for speed; we build for litigation defense. If your dev misses one ARIA label, the law-firm bot still triggers. We provide the Compliance Certificate; does he?" |
| **"I'm too small to be a target."** | "Lawyers don't target big corps anymore—they have legal teams. They target 'soft targets' with \<$5M revenue because they know you'll settle for $10k without a fight." |
| **"I'll do it next month."** | "The bot scans are happening now. Our pilot pricing and the 'Safe Harbor' window for Dec 2025 closes in 48 hours. The cost of waiting is $15,000; the cost of acting is $148." |

## **6\. DISCOUNT STACKING LOGIC**

To be used only to close a "stalled" deal on the consultancy call:

1. **The "Bundle" Credit:** If they buy the $2,500 Manual package, we credit back the $297 they paid for the Shield.  
2. **The "Bulk Template" Cap:** Sites with \>10 templates are capped at **$4,990** (Gross) to ensure we hit the **$5,000 IRS Credit Cap** exactly. This makes the "Full Site Fix" feel like a government-subsidized giveaway.
