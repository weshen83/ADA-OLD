# **🏛️ BRAND VOICE & POSITIONING GUIDE (v1.0)**

This document defines the "Institutional Persona" of the ADA Legal Shield. To command a $297–$5,000 price point, we must sound like a **Regulatory Infrastructure Firm**, not a marketing agency.

## 

## **1\. THE BRAND PERSONA: "THE ARCHITECT"**

We are the **Digital Risk Architects**. We do not "sell software"; we "remediate structural liability."

* **Traits:** Methodical, transparent, slightly detached (clinical), and authoritative.  
* **Perspective:** We view a website not as a marketing tool, but as a **Legal Asset** with inherent vulnerabilities.  
* **The 48-Hour Narrative:** We are currently in a "Forensic Pilot Phase" for the December 2025 litigation surge. This justifies our urgency and our pricing.

## 

## **2\. THE LEXICON (VOICE PROTOCOL)**

To maintain the "Labor Illusion" and authority, we must swap "Marketing Language" for "Institutional Language."

| AVOID (Marketing Speak) | USE (Institutional Speak) | WHY? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| "Cheap / Affordable" | "Cost-Neutral / Subsidized" | Highlights the IRS Section 44 Credit. |
| "Buy / Purchase" | "Authorize / Deploy" | Shifts agency to the user's defense. |
| "Website Plugin" | "Remediation Layer / Shield" | Software is a commodity; a Shield is a necessity. |
| "Check your site" | "Forensic Audit / Technical Scan" | Implies depth and specialized tools. |
| "Lawsuit / Sued" | "Statutory Litigation / Demand Letter" | Sounds more precise and professional. |
| "Fix your errors" | "Mitigate Liability Gaps" | Focuses on the legal outcome, not the task. |

## **3\. CORE POSITIONING PILLARS**

### **A. The "Open Bank Account" Hook**

* **Concept:** A website without ADA code is an open portal for legal withdrawals.  
* **Usage:** Use this to open conversations. It frames the lack of compliance as an active, ongoing financial leak.

### **B. The "Serial Plaintiff" Narrative**

* **Concept:** The threat is not a person; it is an automated legal machine.  
* **Usage:** Explain that law firms use "Bots" to scan 50,000 sites. This justifies our use of technology to fight back. "Fight fire with fire."

### **C. The "Good Faith Effort" Defense**

* **Concept:** Total compliance is a moving target, but "Good Faith Action" is a legal safe harbor.  
* **Usage:** Position the Shield as the "Timestamped Proof" that the business owner took action *before* a letter arrived.

## **4\. RED-TEAM "SPAM & TRUST" FILTERS**

The Red-Team has identified "Trust Killers" that must be purged from all copy:

1. **NO Exclamation Points:** High-authority firms don't shout. Use periods. Let the data provide the punch.  
2. **NO "Guarantees":** We never guarantee "No Lawsuits." We guarantee "Technical Remediation" and "Compliance Certification."  
3. **The "Lawyer" Disclaimer:** Always include: *"We are not a law firm and do not provide legal advice. We provide technical infrastructure designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards."*  
4. **Avoid "Get Compliant Fast":** Replace with "Rapid Deployment of Compliance Layer."

## **5\. DYNAMIC SCRIPTS & SNIPPETS**

### **Julian’s "Closer" Statement:**

"Mr. \[Name\], my team doesn't build websites. We architect the defense layers that keep them from becoming legal liabilities. In the current December 2025 climate, the question isn't if you'll be scanned, but if the scan will find a 'Soft Target' or a 'Hard Target.' Let's make you a Hard Target today."

### **The "Tax Credit" Pivot:**

"The $297 isn't an expense; it's a statutory deduction. Because of Section 44, the IRS effectively pays for half of this shield. You're simply moving money from your tax liability into your digital security."

## **6\. VISUAL TONE (FOR NEXT.JS)**

* **Imagery:** Avoid "Happy People." Use "Audit Logs," "Technical Schematics," and "Official Seals."  
* **Typography:** Clean, high-contrast Sans-Serif (Inter/Roboto) for body; Monospace (JetBrains Mono) for "Forensic Data" to imply code-level accuracy.
