# **⚖️ LEGAL FRAMEWORK & TERMS OF SERVICE (v1.0)**

**Project:** ADA Legal Shield 

**Classification:** Technical Risk Mitigation Services 

**Status:** Mandatory for Deployment

## 

## **1\. THE "NO LEGAL ADVICE" MANDATE (CRITICAL DISCLAIMER)**

This notice must be prominently displayed on the footer of every page and within the first paragraph of the Terms of Service.  
**LEGAL NOTICE:** ADA Legal Shield (the "Company") is a technical service provider and is NOT a law firm. The Company does not provide legal advice, legal representation, or attorney-client services. The use of our forensic audit tools, AI Shield, or manual remediation services does not create an attorney-client relationship. All information provided, including the "Forensic Audit Report," is for technical informational purposes only. Consult with a qualified attorney regarding specific legal threats or demand letters.

## 

## **2\. DEFINITION OF SERVICES**

### **A. The Forensic Audit**

The Audit is a technical "Snapshot" of a website's DOM structure at a specific point in time. It is not an exhaustive legal opinion and may not identify 100% of potential WCAG violations.

### **B. The AI Shield (Phase 1\)**

The AI Shield is an automated remediation layer designed to mitigate "Low-Hanging Fruit" violations (e.g., missing alt-text, basic ARIA labels). It is a "Good Faith" effort to improve accessibility but does not modify the underlying source code of the Client’s website.

### **C. Structural Remediation (Phase 2\)**

Manual remediation involves specific code-level changes to Page Templates. The scope is limited strictly to the templates defined in the **Scope of Work (SOW)**.

## 

## **3\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY & "NO GUARANTEE" CLAUSE**

**The "Serial Plaintiff" Reality:** The Client acknowledges that accessibility compliance is a dynamic and subjective field. While our services are designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, the Company **does not guarantee** that the Client will not receive a demand letter, lawsuit, or regulatory notice.  
**Cap on Liability:** In no event shall the Company’s total liability to the Client for all damages, losses, and causes of action exceed the **total amount paid by the Client** for the specific service in question (e.g., $297 for the Shield).

## 

## **4\. IRS SECTION 44 DISCLAIMER**

Regarding the Disabled Access Credit:

* The Company provides documentation (Form 8826\) as a convenience.  
* The Company does not guarantee eligibility for the credit.  
* The Client is solely responsible for verifying their eligibility with a qualified tax professional (CPA).

## 

## **5\. REFUND & CHARGEBACK POLICY**

### **A. All Sales Final**

Due to the digital nature of the AI Shield and the labor-intensive nature of Manual Remediation, all sales are final upon deployment of the code or delivery of the Audit report.

### **B. Chargeback Defense**

The Client agrees that the delivery of a "Statement of Compliance" and a "Forensic Audit Log" constitutes full performance of the contract. Any attempt to initiate a chargeback for services rendered will be contested using these timestamped delivery logs.

## 

## **6\. STATUTORY COMPLIANCE & DATA PRIVACY**

* **Data Usage:** We store only the forensic metrics required to generate reports and fulfill services.  
* **Third-Party Tools:** The Client authorizes the use of automated scanners (Playwright/Chromium) to access their public-facing website for auditing purposes.

## 

## **7\. RED-TEAM RISK CONTROLS (LEGAL DEFENSE)**

**1\. The "Good Faith" Log:** Every client must receive a timestamped "Audit Log" upon purchase. In the event of a lawsuit, this document is the Client's primary evidence that they were actively taking "Good Faith Actions" to remediate their site—a key defense in many federal jurisdictions.  
**2\. The "Active Monitoring" Clause:** The Terms must state that the AI Shield is a "Service," not a "Product." It remains active as long as the snippet is on the site. If the Client removes the snippet, the Company is not liable for any subsequent violations.  
**3\. Venue & Jurisdiction:** All disputes shall be settled in the jurisdiction of \[Your Registered Business Location\], using binding arbitration to avoid public court costs.
