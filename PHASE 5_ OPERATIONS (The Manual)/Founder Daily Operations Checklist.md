## 

## **🛠️ RECURRING "SYSTEM PULSE" (EVERY 4 HOURS)**

*These tasks must be done by the "Active" founder.*

1. **Check n8n Error Logs:** Ensure no "Stripe Webhook" failures.  
2. **Verify Proxy Health:** If "Proxy Failures" \> 10%, rotate.  
3. **Attio Cleanup:** Ensure all Person records have a Company linked.  
4. **Spam Check:** Monitor the "Burner Domain" inbox for any "Cease & Desist" or legal threats. (Move to Crisis SOP if found).

## 

## **🛑 RED-TEAM "SUCCESS CATASTROPHE" CONTROLS**

**1\. The "Call Volume" Trap:**

* **Risk:** Julian has 20 calls booked in 4 hours and cannot fulfill them.  
* **Response:** Increase the "Minimum Qualifying Revenue" in the Next.js form. Only allow calls for businesses with \>$1M revenue or \>5 templates.

**2\. The "Fulfillment" Bottleneck:**

* **Risk:** 15 Manual Remediations sold; Partner Agency is overwhelmed.  
* **Response:** Increase the "Estimated Start Date" in the SOW to 14 days. Raise the price per page by 20% to slow demand while increasing margin.

**3\. The "Founder Fatigue" Warning:**

* **Risk:** Founders making mistakes in Attio or n8n logic due to sleep deprivation.  
* **Response:** **Hard Stop.** If profit \>$10k, pause the bot for 4 hours of mandatory synchronized sleep. A broken system costs more than a paused one.
