# **📞 MANUAL REMEDIATION SALES SCRIPT (v1.0 \- FINAL)**

Role: Technical Compliance Officer (Julian)  
Target: Shield Buyers with "High\_Ticket\_Prospect" Tag (E-com/Complex Forms)  
Objective: Close $1,395 \- $4,990 Manual Remediation Contracts  
Tone: Institutional, Clinical, Detached, Authoritative.

## **PHASE 1: THE INSTITUTIONAL OPENING (0:00 \- 1:30)**

*Goal: Establish absolute authority and frame the call as a "Diagnostic Review."*

**Julian:** "Hi \[Name\], this is Julian from the ADA Shield technical team. I’m calling regarding the forensic diagnostic we ran for **\[Domain\]** on **\[Date\]**. I have the structural report in front of me. Do you have the three minutes we scheduled to review these specific vulnerabilities?"

* **The Voss Label:** (If they sound rushed) "It sounds like you’re in the middle of something critical. Should we push this ten minutes, or is the $15,000 exposure window something we need to close right now?"  
* **The Frame:** You are not calling to sell; you are calling to "Review the Report."

## **PHASE 2: THE "GAP" DISCOVERY (1:30 \- 4:00)**

*Goal: Acknowledge the Shield's success while highlighting the "Manual" vulnerability.*

**Julian:** "First, the good news. Your **Emergency AI Shield** is active. It has successfully obfuscated your site from the automated 'Drive-By' scrapers that law firms are using this week. You've effectively vanished from their bots."

**Julian (The Pivot):** "However, my manual review flagged a **Structural Logic Trap** in your **\[Checkout Flow/Booking Form\]**. The AI Shield stops bots, but it cannot fix 'Hard-Coded Logic.' If a professional plaintiff—an actual human—manually audits that specific path, the Shield cannot hide the underlying code defect. Does that distinction make sense?"

* **Red-Team Note:** Don't say "The Shield isn't enough." Say "The Shield stops bots; Humans require surgery."

## **PHASE 3: THE IMPLICATION (4:00 \- 6:00)**

*Goal: Anchor the cost of inaction against the $15,000 settlement risk.*

**Julian:** "In Dec 2025, the trend we’re seeing is 'Serial Plaintiffs' targeting the **\[Checkout/Cart\]** specifically. They ignore the homepage and go straight for the transaction. If they find a 'Keyboard Trap' there, they file. In New York or California, the statutory damages start at $4,000, but the settlement typically settles around **$12,500 to $15,000** once you factor in their attorney fees."

**Julian (Tactical Silence):** "How would a $15,000 unbudgeted legal expense affect your operations for Q1?"

* *Wait for them to speak.* This is the "Voss Silence." Let them feel the weight of the number.

## **PHASE 4: THE "TEMPLATE MATH" SOLUTION (6:00 \- 8:00)**

*Goal: Explain the "Per-Template" pricing as a massive value surplus.*

**Julian:** "The forensic fix is what we call **Manual Structural Remediation**. We don't charge 'per page' because that would be $50,000 for a site your size. We charge **'Per Template.'** Your site uses **\[X\]** core templates."

**Julian (The IRS Anchor):** "The retail is $558 per template. But because of your **IRS Section 44 eligibility**, the government effectively subsidizes 50%. Your net cost is only **$279 per template**. We hard-code the fix so it’s human-proof, permanent, and satisfies the 'Universal Standard of Care'."

## **PHASE 5: THE CLOSE (8:00 \- 10:00)**

*Goal: Move to "Authorization" without a "Hard Sell."*

**Julian:** "I’ve mapped out **\[X\]** templates that need 'Surgery.' The total authorization would be **$\[Amount\]**. After your tax credit, your real-world out-of-pocket is **$\[Net Amount\]**. To be clear, this is a one-time forensic fix, not a subscription."

**Julian:** "I have a slot open with our engineering lead on Thursday to begin the code-injection. Should I send the Authorization over to your email now so we can lock in that window and close this liability?"

## **HANDLING OBJECTIONS (THE DEFENSE VAULT)**

### **Objection: "Can't my developer do this?"**

* **Response:** "Your developer is likely a great designer, but are they a **Forensic A11y Engineer**? Most devs build for 'Sight.' We build for 'Compliance.' If your dev misses one ARIA-label, you’re still 100% liable. We provide a **Conformance Letter** that your dev simply cannot sign off on."

### **Objection: "It's too expensive right now."**

* **Response:** "I understand. Budgeting for compliance is never fun. But let me ask: Is it more expensive to authorize **$1,500** for a permanent fix today, or to write a **$15,000** check to a plaintiff's lawyer in 90 days? One is an investment in your asset; the other is a total loss."

### **Objection: "I thought the $297 covered everything."**

* **Response:** "The $297 provides the **Emergency Shield**—it stops 99% of automated attacks. This manual remediation is for the 1% of human plaintiffs who are specifically hunting high-revenue businesses like yours. It’s the difference between a 'Security Alarm' (The Shield) and 'Bulletproof Glass' (The Remediation)."

## **RED-TEAM FINAL CHECKLIST FOR JULIAN**

1. **Never say "Sell" or "Buy".** Use "Authorize," "Deploy," "Remediate," and "Close the Exposure."  
2. **Speak slowly.** High-status individuals speak slower. Low-status individuals rush to get the words out before they are interrupted.  
3. **Use "We."** "We are going to close this window," "We need to protect the asset." It positions you as a partner, not an adversary.
